## Particle Slider Animation Example

I came across a software firm's website called https://whiterabbit.group/
and was fascinated by the particle animation of their logo which on mouse hover or movement would distort the particles constituting their logo.
On further inspecting and searching through the console. I came across a js library called Particle Slider. I decided to recreate the same. Particle Slider library uses base encoded png image and accepts certain parameters for controlling the size of particles, distance between the particles and finally renders the same.
Added the markup with relevant scripts and css in a single html file and deployed to Netlify.
